\section*{Preface}

This report is about my thoughts on why we need to come up with a different and better way of doing conservation. Despite the best efforts of conservationists and preservationists in the past century, we find ourselves in the middle of a biodiversity extinction event of an unprecedented scale and rate. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that this extinction event is caused, in large part, by our consumerist tendencies and our abuse of public goods. However, few conservation efforts have tried to deal with these issues that are undeniably more social than legal or political. Thus, I believe that it is imperative that we begin to take the power of social forces into consideration when designing conservation policies.

My thoughts have been shaped by conversations I have had with experts in many different fields as well as by the literature that has been produced by these and other experts. Thus, this report will start with a brief literature review of some of the important ideas that I have come across. The literature review will begin with a brief history of conservation in the United States. In this section, I will point out what I perceive to be the shortcomings of different conservation approaches that have been used in the past and that are being currently used as well. This will, hopefully, motivate the need for a new way of thinking about how to achieve our desired conservation goals.

I will then introduce social norms (section \ref{sec:norms}) as a possible tool that we could use in doing conservation. In this section, I will introduce the different schools of thoughts on social norms, their predictions for how social norms originate, evolve, change, and their respective shortcomings. I will also take a brief look at norm interventions and how they have been used in different situations to change inefficient or harmful social norms. In the next few chapters, I will introduce my ideas on how I plan to contribute to the knowledge of social norms and how I think they can be used in doing conservation more effectively. 

Chapter \ref{ch:usefulness} will deal with my ideas on determining which social norms we as conservationists need to focus on in order to affect the most significant amount of change. I will also try to address a number of social scientists' concern that changing social norms might not make much of a difference to conservation outcomes. In the final two chapters, I will discuss how I hope to contribute to the understanding of social norms, particularly conservation related social norms. Chapter \ref{ch:field} will outline some of the field experiments and surveys I hope to undertake in the next few years, and in chapter \ref{ch:models}, I will provide details about some of the models of social norms that I would like to investigate mathematically.

This report is probably best read linearly, but anyone familiar with social norms can skip ahead to section \ref{subsec:interventions} after section \ref{sec:history}. Even for readers familiar with the history of conservation, I would encourage skimming section \ref{sec:history} because my motivation for trying to change social norms derives in large part from the matter presented in that section. While chapters \ref{ch:usefulness}, \ref{ch:field}, and \ref{ch:models} inform each other, they are fairly independent and can be read in any order.
